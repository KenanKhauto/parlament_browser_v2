## Project Status

**Note: This project is currently under development.**


## Overview

The project aims to develop a web application that scrapes data from the Bundestag website, parses the XML files into 
Python data structures, and stores them in a MongoDB database. The application utilizes various NLP techniques such as POS 
tagging and sentiment analysis to analyze the data. Users can access the web app, which displays the stored data, provides data 
analysis charts and diagrams, and offers the ability to analyze the sentiment of individual protocols. The project is designed to 
update itself live whenever new protocols are available, ensuring the latest data is always accessible on the website.
